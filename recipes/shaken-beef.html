            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Shaking Beef (Bo Luc Lac in Vietnamese or Beef Lok Lak in Khmer) is a french-inspired dish of wok-seared cubed steak that’s been marinated in a soy-based sauce then quickly sauteed with garlic, onion, and butter.</p>

            <p>Lúc Lắc means to shake in Vietnamese. The dish got its name from the constant shaking of the wok that’s needed to get a nice crust on each individual steak cube.</p>

            <p>The wok-seared beef is served on a bed of lettuce, watercress, tomato and/or cucumbers, and lime-salt-and-pepper dipping sauce on the side. You can have it on its own as an appetizer or with steamed rice for a complete meal.</p>

            <p>Bo Luc Lac is not a common home-cooked dish. It's more of a celebratory dish that is eaten as an appetizer. However, nowadays, you now can find Bo Luc Lac served with rice in many Vietnamese restaurants.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Prepare Everything Together</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, marinate beef with sugar, salt, black pepper, and minced garlic for at least 10 minutes. In a small bowl, make the sauce by mixing together soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, rice vinegar, and sugar. Add sugar a little at a time to taste. Leave out the aromatics (onions and garlic) at this point.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat up vegetable oil on high. Add the beef cubes and sear on all sides by shaking the beef until medium rare. It's highly recommended to do this in batches to get a nice sear without overcooking. No more than 3 minutes total. Transfer beef to a plate and set aside.</li>
                    <li>To the now empty skillet, add butter. Once melted, add onions and garlic. Sautee until fragrant (about 1-2 minutes). Add sauce mixture and seared beef cubes. Toss until nicely coated. Transfer beef and sauce onto a bed of lettuce, tomatoes, and/or cucumbers. Serve shaking beef with rice, and optional dipping sauce by mixing together lime juice, salt, and pepper.</li>
                </ol>
