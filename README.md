Hi All,

I am currently working on The Odin Project and this will be my first completed HTML recipes webpage. In this project you will see that I have learned how to link images, absolute webpages, and relative webpages properly. 

As I completed this project, it makes me wonder how long ago I could have learned all of this. Very happy to say that this is only the beginning. 

Please check it out and if there are any comments, reach out!
